2. Organization: Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal) or group them by priority, due date, or other criteria.

3. Productivity: Help users increase productivity by keeping their tasks organized and accessible, reducing the likelihood of forgetting important activities.

4. User-Friendly Interface: Provide a clean, intuitive interface that is easy to navigate, making it simple for users of all ages and technical skills to use.
